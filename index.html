                    <p>Building a responsive website without relying on frameworks like Bootstrap or libraries like jQuery is not only possible but can result in faster, leaner websites. Here's how I did it...</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Approach</h2>
                    <p>I started with a mobile-first approach, writing CSS that would work well on small screens and then adding media queries to adapt the layout for larger screens.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The HTML Structure</h2>
                    <p>Semantic HTML5 elements like header, nav, main, article, and footer provide good structure and accessibility out of the box.</p>
